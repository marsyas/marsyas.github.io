<h3 class="section">1.2 Context and Related Work</h3>


<p>There is a lot of interesting related work and inspiration behind the
design of this framework. As the goal of this introduction is to
provide a quick overview of the system I will just briefly mention
some of the key ideas that strongly influenced the design of the
system without getting into details. Probably the most central
inspiration has been the huge legacy of computer music synthesis
languages such as the Music V family, Csound etc. More recent work
that has been influential to the design of the system has been the
architecture of the Synthesis Toolkit (STK) and the hierarchical
control naming scheme of Open Sound Control (OSC). Other influences
include the use of Design Patterns for creating the object oriented
architecture of the system, kernel stream architectures as well as
data flow simulation software systems such as SimuLink by Matlab and
the FilterGraph by Microsoft.  Finally many of the ideas of functional
programming such as the clear separation of mutable and immutable
data and the use of composition to build complicated systems have been
another major source of inspiration.
</p>
<p>There is a plethora of programming languages, frameworks and
environments for the analysis and synthesis of audio signals. The
processing of audio signals requires extensive numerical calculations
over large amounts of data especially when real-time performance is
desired. Therefore efficiency has always been a major concern in the
design of audio analysis and synthesis systems. Dataflow programming
is based on the idea of expressing computation as a network of
processing nodes/components connected by a number of communication
channels/arcs. Computer Music is possibly one of the most successful
application areas for the dataflow programming paradigm. The origins
of this idea can possibly be traced to the physical re-wiring
(patching) employed for changing sound characteristics in early
modular analog synthesizers. From the pioneering work on unit
generators in the Music N family of language to currently popular
visual programming environments such as Max/Msp and Pure Data (PD),
the idea of patching components to build systems is familiar to most
computer music practitioners.
</p>
<p>Expressing audio processing systems as dataflow networks has several
advantages. The programmer can provide a declarative specification of
what needs to be computed without having to worry about the low level
implementation details. The resulting code can be very efficient and
have low memory requirements as data just &ldquo;flows&rdquo; through the
network without having complicated dependencies. In addition, dataflow
approaches are particularly suited for visual programming. One of the
initial motivation for dataflow ideas was the exploitation of parallel
hardware and therefore dataflow systems are particularly suited for
parallel and distributed computation.
</p>
<p>Despite these advantages, dataflow programming has not managed to
become part of mainstream programming and replace existing imperative,
object-oriented and functional languages. Some of the traditional
criticisms aimed at dataflow programming include: the difficulty of
expressing complicated control information, the restrictions on using
assignment and global state information, the difficulty of expressing
iteration and complicated data structures, and the challenge of
synchronization.
</p>
<p>There are two main ways that existing successful dataflow systems
overcome these limitations. The first is to embed dataflow ideas into
an existing programming language. This is called coarse-grained
dataflow in contrast to fine-grained dataflow where the entire
computation is expressed as a flow graph. With coarse-grained
dataflow, complicated data structures, iteration, and state
information are handled in the host language while using dataflow for
structured modularity. The second way is to work on a domain whose
nature and specific constraints are a good fit to a dataflow
approach. For example, audio and multimedia processing typically deals
with fixed-rate calculation of large buffers of numerical data.
</p>
<p>Computer music has been one of the most successful cases of dataflow
applications even though the academic dataflow community doesn&rsquo;t seem
to be particularly aware of this fact. Existing audio processing
dataflow frameworks have difficulty handling spectral and filterbank
data in an conceptually clear manner. Another problem is the
restriction of using fixed buffer sizes and therefore fixed audio and
control rates. Both of these limitations can be traced to the
restricted semantics of patching as well as the need to explicitly
specify connections. Implicit Patching the technique used in
Marsyas-0.2 is an attempt to overcome these problems while maintaining
the advantages of dataflow computation.
