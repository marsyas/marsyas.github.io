<h3 class="section">1.1 History</h3>

<p>Work on Marsyas started in 1998 during my second year of graduate
studies in Computer Science at Princeton University under the
supervision of Dr. Perry Cook.
<a name="index-Perry-Cook"></a>
The main motivation behind the design and development of the toolkit
was and still is to personally code the majority of the tools I need
for my research in order to have understanding and control of how they
work. Marsyas has been used for every paper I have published since
that time. I continued to add code to Marsyas until 2000 when it was
clear that certain major design decisions needed to be revised.  That
made me start a major rewrite/redesign of the framework and that was
the start of the first &ldquo;real&rdquo; Marsyas version which was numbered
0.1. Soon after Sourceforge was used to host Marsyas. Version 0.1 is
still widely used by a variety of academic and industry groups around
the world but it is slowly being phased out. .
</p>
<p>In 2002 while being a PostDoctoral Fellow at Carnegie Mellon
University working with Roger Dannenberg I decided to start porting
algorithms from the Synthesis Toolkit (STK) by Perry Cook and Gary
Scavone into Marsyas.  This effort as well as many interesting
conversations with Roger made me rethink the design used by Marsyas.
The result was to move to a dataflow model of audio computation with
general matrices instead of 1-D arrays as data and an Open Sound
Control (OSC) inspired hierarchical messaging system used to control
the dataflow network. Marsyas 0.2 is now almost to the point of
supporting the full functionality of Marsyas 0.1. Hopefully the
writing of this manual will help users migrate from version 0.1. If
you are a user that has done work in 0.1 it should be relatively
straightforward to figure out how to recode your algorithms in version
0.2. Also if you have code in 0.1 that you would like help porting in
0.2 I would be more than happy to help - just drop me an email.
</p>
<p>The community of Marsyas developers has grown over the years with
currently (Spring 2009) approximately 4-5 developers committing
regularly code and close to 30 developers having committed code over the
past few years. 
</p>

<p>We are very proud that Marsyas is used for a variety of
projects in both academia and industry and looking forward to continue
growing and expanding the framework with your help.
</p>



<p>have fun,
